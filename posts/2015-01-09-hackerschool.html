<p>I’m finally doing Hacker School! Woohoo! I first heard about Hacker School at my first Python meetup. They had this thing called lightning talks, and one of the Hacker School alumni talked about this “writer’s retreat for programmers”. I was like “OMG! This is what I’ve been looking for!” I’ve always been sort of bored of the traditional approach to learning programming at regular schools. I’ve done plenty of the fill-in-the-blanks and the omg-it-is-due-at-midnight kinds of programming. I’ve always wanted a safe space where I can code up something big, and never worry about deadlines and GPAs. Now that I’ve finished my masters degree, I finally have the time to be a full time Hacker Schooler!</p>
<p>At Hacker School I’d like to: 1. Implement a Python compiler in Haskell 2. Learn about web development. Probably build a geo-related web app. 3. Learn more about other functional languages such as Scala and Ocaml. 4. Learn how to contribute to open source software. Probably add new features to the Lambdabot.</p>
<p>I might be over-planning here, but I’m pretty sure I will be learning a ton.</p>
